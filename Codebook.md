calculated means are unitless values within the range [-1,1] as well.

-The first name element is either 'time' or 'frequency' indicating a time-domain or frequency-domain variable, 
 respectively.
 
-If the last name element is X, Y or Z, the variable name refers to a measurement along the X, Y or Z axis.

-The name element StdDev refers to a standard deviation measurement.
